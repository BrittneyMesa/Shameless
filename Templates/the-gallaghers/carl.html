	  <h1>Carl Gallagher</h1>
	  <p>Carl Francis Gallagher (Ethan Cutkosky) is the second-youngest Gallagher child (14). He shares a room with older brothers Lip and Ian, who try to keep their more adult interests from him. Carl is often in trouble at school for attacking other students. In his early years, he displays several psychopathic tendencies such as mutilating his toys and killing stray animals, although this behavior seems to be less prevalent as he ages, and he begins to show concern for Frank. His bond with Frank is strengthened after Frank convinces him he has cancer (for one of his schemesâ€”later &quot;cured&quot;), and Carl helps him stay in the van after being kicked out. Later, Frank somewhat inexplicably takes the blame for a heist he and Carl have committed. In season 4, when Frank's liver fails, Carl takes it on himself to find him an organ donor, and commits many crimes with Bonnie, doing a store robbery and stealing a car to do a ram and grab, starting a pseudo-sexual relationship with her. In season 5, Carl is walking with crutches (Which according to Debbie happened because of a skateboarding accident.). Not long after stealing a mobility scooter, Holly Herkimer takes sexual interest on Carl and starts making out with him (Likely to intimidate Debbie). In s5e9, Carl deliberately gets himself sentenced to a maximum sentence at Juvie to &quot;get his education and street cred&quot;.</p>
