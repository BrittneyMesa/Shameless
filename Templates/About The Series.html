      <h1>About The Series </h1>
      <p>Shameless is an American television comedy-drama which airs on Showtime. This remake of the award-winning British series is set in Chicago's Canaryville neighborhood on the South Side, although filmed in Los Angeles, with the exterior scenes filmed in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The series depicts the dysfunctional family of Frank Gallagher, a single father of six children. While he spends his days drunk, his kids learn to take care of themselves. The show's producers sought to distinguish it from previous American working-class shows by highlighting how Frank's alcoholism affects his family. Paul Abbott, creator of the original, said, &quot;It's not My Name Is Earl or Roseanne. It's got a much graver level of poverty attached to it. It's not blue collar; it's no collar.&quot; When John Wells, the showrunner, began pitching the show, he had to fight efforts to place the show in the South or in a trailer park. He explained, &quot;We have a comedic tradition of making fun of the people in those worlds. The reality is that these people aren't 'the other' â€“ they're people who live four blocks down from you and two blocks over&quot;.</p>
